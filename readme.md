# hueburt

I got some hue lights. They're pretty fun. Most of the projects you
find out there are generic controllers (light set lights, get bridge,
etc etc). These are totally awesome and useful, but I wanted more,
lets say "recipies". More commands. Things like `pulse` and a color.
Or `danceParty` and a list of colors to go through. Perhaps something
themed like `xmas` or `4thJuly`.

This repo builds off one of those great Hue controlling libraries,
but the focus here is on effects and recipies for your lights.
